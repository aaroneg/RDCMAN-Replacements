# RDCMAN-Replacements
Simple scripts to easily replace RDCMan, as it's now deprecated

## RoyalTS-All-By-Windows-Server-OS.ps1
Gets all Windows Server OS machines by AD object. You should have RoyalTS already installed before running it, as the powershell module comes with the app.

# Note

I had intended this to be for a couple of different options, including royalTS and mRemoteNG - however mRemoteNG doesn't make this easy and already provides a powershell script to accomplish this.

See [mRemoteNG Documentation](https://mremoteng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtos/bulk_connections.html) for details on their proposed method.

At this point, it's just going to be RoyalTS but I will accept suggestions.
